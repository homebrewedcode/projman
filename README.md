#Projman
##A simple project manager
This is program will allow you to add projects, then add tasks to projects.
It is basically just a todo app, where you create what you want "To Do" and create tasks associated with it.
My goal with this app is to enhance the skills I've learned so far with Rails, at least to start with:
*Create basic CRUD operations (create projects and tasks for each project)
*Make associations between project and tasks tables (so each task "belongs to" a specific project)
*get it styled with bootstrap

I'll eventually add the following:
*Make users, and have them belong to tasks/projects
*Add User authentication
*Allow Users to create their own projects, and add tasks to their own projects
*Allow other users to view projects and tasks
*Allow user to allow other users to add tasks to a given project

It's not much but gotta start somewhere!
